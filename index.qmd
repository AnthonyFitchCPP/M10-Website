I'm a Distribution Engineer at Southern California Edison, where I work to ensure the safe and efficient delivery of power across our communities. I'm currently pursuing my MBA at Cal Poly Pomona with the goal of moving into a management role within SCE. I'm passionate about both leadership and technical growth, and I plan to return to school in the future to earn a master's degree in engineering or physics. Long term, I hope to share my knowledge by teaching and mentoring the next generation of engineers.
