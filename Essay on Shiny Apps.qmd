Pasted below is the Raw Code needed to Run a Shiny App, it gives the basic structure with comments to help guide you whats happening. Run the code and see what happens, and any additional stuff to add please refer to online material to help learn more about shiny apps. The Raw code starts below: 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# This is a Shiny web application. You can run the application by clicking
# the 'Run App' button above.

library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
#Dropdown menu the user can use to choose from a list of selections
  selectInput(inputId = "greeting", 
              label = "Who do you want to greet, the greeting will be shown below",
              choices = c("world" = "Hello, world!", "friends" = "Hi, friends!", "people"= "Hey, people!")),
  
  #Output Display that we will render below in the server
  textOutput("greeting_text"),
  #You can also creat these other outputs
  #tableOutput("Table_name")
  #plotOutput("Plot_name")
  
# Text input the user can type in answering a question
  textInput(inputId = "greeting",
            label = "Who do you want to greet",
            value = "Type your name"),
  
  sliderInput(inputId = "age",
              label = "How old are you?",
              min = 10, max = 90, value = 10),
#Output Display that we will render below in the server
  textOutput("older")
)


server <- function(input, output, session) {
#Render the selected greeting

  output$greeting_text <- renderText({input$greeting})
  
  output$older <- renderText(input$age)
   
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
